# 機能要件
## Requirements
You should create a web page that includes the following elements:

- Create a simple task management application following the given design.
- By default, it should show a board with 4 tasks like in the design.
- Users can edit task name, description, icon, and status.
- Users can delete tasks by selecting Delete button.
- When users select Add new task option, a new task is added with a default name.
- Users can edit board name and optionally, users can edit board description as well.
- When users first visit the app, a new board with a unique id is created and saved to the database or alternatively a board is created after users make the first change.
- Each board can be accessed by a unique id, e.g: /board/:board-id
- Deploy the solution and submit Repository URL and Demo URL.

## Technical Details

## Front-end Development
1. Framework: Use React for building the user interface.
1. State Management: Use a state management tool like Zustand or Redux for managing state.
1. Styling: Use CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components, tailwind or traditional CSS for styling.
1. 画面設計は/designを参照

## Back-end Development
1. Framework: Use Node.js with Express.js or Next.js to create the server.
1. Database: Use a database of your choice (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL) for storing tasks and boards.

## API Endpoints
1. GET /api/boards/:board-id: Retrieve a board by its ID.
1. POST /api/boards: Create a new board and return the generated ID.
1. PUT /api/boards/:board-id: Update a board by its ID.
1. DELETE /api/boards/:board-id: Delete a board by its ID.
1. PUT /api/tasks/:task-id: Update a task by its ID.
1. DELETE /api/tasks/:task-id: Delete a task by its ID.

## Default Task Board
- By default, the task board should have the following columns: "In Progress", "Completed", and "Won't do".
- Each column should have a default task: "Task in Progress", "Task Completed", and "Task Won't Do".
- Users can edit the task name, description, icon, and status.

## Add New Task Functionality
- When users select the "Add new task" option, a new task is added with a default name.
- Users can edit the task name, description, icon, and status.

## Board Management
- Users can edit the board name and optionally, the board description.
- When users first visit the app, a new board with a unique id is created and saved to the database. Alternatively, a board is created after users make the first change.
- Each board can be accessed by a unique id, e.g: /board/:board-id.

## Deployment
1. Front-end: Deploy the React app on Netlify or Vercel.
1. Back-end: Deploy the Node.js server on Heroku, AWS, or Vercel.
